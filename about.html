                            Eros Camacho-Ruiz received his PhD in Physical Sciences and Technology from the University of Seville in 2024. He focuses on the research of hardware implementations of cryptographic algorithms developed to date which includes the study and use of symmetric key, asymmetric key and digital signature algorithms, as well as post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) algorithms. He has developed accelerations of PQC algorithms at both software and hardware levels, adding also countermeasures against side-channel attacks. His research experience includes several European projects such as SPIRS or QUBIP in which he has participated in the development of Root-of-Trusts and Secure Elements with Post-Quantum capability. Integrating these modules in IoT devices and security platforms, performing secure interconnection between them.
